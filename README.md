# R-ggplot2-vs-Matlab-Plot

The cheat sheet provides codes for frequently graphs in the language of both R with package ggplot2 and Matlab. It should be noted that Matlab differs from R and other programming language in some functions, like the use of histograms and bar plots. Hopefully, through the side-by-side contrast, the cheat sheet will help the beginners of Matlab plotting have a smooth start.
